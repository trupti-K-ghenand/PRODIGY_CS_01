# PRODIGY_CS_01
👾Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Internship Task 1 at Prodigy InfoTech

Overview🧐
This repository contains two Python programs that implement the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform the encryption and decryption operations. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Theoretical Explanation🤔
The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so on. The decryption process reverses the shift. This algorithm is a simple form of encryption and serves as an introduction to the concepts of cryptography and cybersecurity.

🕵️‍♀️Cybersecurity Concepts
Encryption🔒: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect information from unauthorized access.
Decryption🔓: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
Cipher🧩: An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption.
Key🗝️: A piece of information that determines the functional output of the cryptographic algorithm. In this case, the shift value.
