## 🛡️ Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption 
Internship Task 1 at Prodigy InfoTech

## 📜 Overview
This program implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher 
in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. 
This tool allows users to input a message and two shift values (keys) to perform encryption and decryption.

## 📚 Theoretical Explanation

## 🔐 Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Concepts
- Encryption🔒: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect information from unauthorized access.
- Decryption🔓: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
- Cipher🧩: An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption.
- Key🗝️: A piece of information that determines the functional output of the cryptographic algorithm. In this case, the shift value.

## 📝 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Knowledge of string manipulation and loops.

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Python 3.x

## 🖥️ Hardware Requirements
- A computer with at least 2GB of RAM.
- Any operating system that supports Python 3.x.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python

## 🚀Steps to Execute the Program
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-directory> (https://github.com/trupti-K-ghenand/PRODIGY_CS_01)
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

 2.**Run the Program:**
- Open the program in your Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
- Execute the script `task1_CaesarCipher.ipynb` .
- Follow the prompts to enter the text and the shift value.

3.**Example Execution:**
- Input: "hello world"
- Key1: 3
- key2: 4
- Encrypted Text: "kiopr zsupg"
- Decrypted Text: "hello world"

## Code Details🗂️
# 📄Program : task1_CaesarCipher.ipynb
This program provides an enhanced implementation of the Caesar Cipher that supports case-sensitive alphabetic characters, numeric characters, and special characters.

## Explanation:
1. **Encryption Function**:
    - The `encrypt` function iterates through each character in the `plain_text`.
    - It determines if the character is alphabetic.
    - Depending on the character's index (even or odd), it uses either `key1` or `key2` to shift the character.
    - The base value is set according to whether the character is uppercase or lowercase.
    - The shifted character is calculated and appended to `cipher_text`.

2. **Decryption Function**:
    - The `decrypt` function processes the `cipher_text` similarly to how the `encrypt` function does.
    - Instead of adding the shift value, it subtracts it to reverse the encryption.
    - The resultant characters are appended to `plain_text`.

3. **User Interaction**:
    - The user is prompted to input the text to be encrypted and the two keys.
    - The encrypted text is printed.
    - The decrypted text (which should match the original input) is printed to verify the correctness of the encryption and decryption process.
